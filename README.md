## Description
This assignment was meant to create a portfolio page to highlight a developer’s skills. Using React, I set up a page for fictional developer “John Doe” and links to different sections of the page regarding John’s history, contact, resume, and portfolio. I started with a class exercise and continued to add elements to match the requirements. Due to time limitations, I was not able to get farther than this.

## Installation
